# Financial-Statement
Practice app for learning to code in vanilla Javascript.
Coded along as part of the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course: Build A Real-World Project". 
For apps that I coded entirely on my own, see my "Codeducation" and "To-Do-List" repositories.

An update is planned for December 2018 to include an assets-liabilities section, turning this app into a complete financial statement generator rather than a mere monthly budget calculator.
